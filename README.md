# SimpleCounter
This is my second project, developed in conclusion of JavaScript Basics chapter on [Start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it).

it's a simple counter created mostly with Javascript where you can increase and decrease the value of the counter by pressing "+" and "-" keys or you can reset the value to 0 with the "reset" button.

You can also increase the value by pressing right or up keys or by scrolling up your mouse wheel.

Other ways to decrease the value are by pressing down or left keys or by scrolling down your mouse wheel.
